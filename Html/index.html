          <p class="article-body">
            Work is often a major source of stress. People get frustrated, it
            ruins their relationship with others and it leads to burnout. By
            keeping your work life as simple as possible, it will help balance
            everything out.

          <h2 class="article-title">Simple decorations</h2>
          <p class="article-body">
            A home isn't a home until you've decorated a little. People either
            don't decorate, or they go overboard and it doesn't have the impact
            they were hoping for. Staying simple will help draw the eye where
            you want it to and make things pop like never before.
